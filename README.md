# üìà Global Stock Analysis Panel

This project is a **web browser extension** that provides a comprehensive platform for **real-time stock market analysis**. It is designed to offer investors and enthusiasts instant access to key financial data, technical indicators, and visualizations for a wide range of stocks across multiple global markets. The extension combines a robust Python backend with a modern, responsive frontend to deliver a seamless user experience directly in the browser.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Multi-Market Data:** Access live and historical data for stocks listed on **Borsa ƒ∞stanbul (BIST)**, major **US markets**, and popular **cryptocurrencies**. The extension provides a unified view of these diverse markets.
* **Advanced Technical Indicators:** Analyze stock performance using essential technical indicators such as **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**, **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**, and **MACD**. These indicators are calculated and presented in an easy-to-understand format.
* **Interactive Charts:** Visualize stock price movements and technical indicators with dynamic charts powered by **Chart.js**. Users can switch between different chart types (e.g., line, candlestick) to suit their analysis needs.
* **Modern & Intuitive UI:** The extension features a clean, minimalist, and responsive user interface with a sleek dark theme. The design is optimized for efficiency, allowing users to quickly navigate and find the information they need.
* **Efficient Data Handling:** A dedicated Python backend server built with **Flask** handles all data fetching from the **Finnhub API**. This data is then stored and managed in a local **SQLite3** database, ensuring fast access and reduced API call overhead.

## üì¶ Installation

To get this project up and running, you need to set up both the backend server and the browser extension.

### 1. Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/KullaniciAdin/ProjeAdin.git](https://github.com/KullaniciAdin/ProjeAdin.git)
    cd ProjeAdin
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:** All necessary Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`. It will automatically initialize the database and begin fetching data for the default stock list.

### 2. Browser Extension Setup

1.  Open your browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Brave).
2.  Navigate to the extensions management page (e.g., `chrome://extensions`).
3.  Enable **Developer Mode** in the top right corner.
4.  Click **Load unpacked** and select the project directory where your `manifest.json` file is located. The extension icon will now appear in your toolbar.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The project's architecture is divided into two parts:

* **Backend (`app.py`):** A Flask server that acts as a data provider. It uses the Finnhub API to retrieve real-time stock prices and historical data. It also performs technical analysis calculations and stores all the information in a local SQLite3 database for quick retrieval. A background thread ensures data is updated periodically.
* **Frontend (`popup.html`, `popup.js`):** The browser extension's user interface. It communicates with the local Flask server to fetch stock data. The `popup.js` script handles all user interactions, data filtering, and rendering of the charts using the Chart.js library.
